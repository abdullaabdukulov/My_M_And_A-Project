# My_M_And_A-Project
The process of making the 'My_M_and_A' project was very interesting. The main task of doing this project was: 3 different csv data came in, I had to clean them up, sort them the same, and convert them to sql. I managed them. It's too loose. I will definitely do the prophetic part of it as well, which I am currently studying in depth.
